INT 0x10 - VIDEO TELETYPE OUTPUT

AH = 0x0E
AL = Character to write
BH - Page Number (Should be 0)
BL = Foreground color (Graphics Modes Only)

For example:
	xor	bx, bx		; A faster method of clearing BX to 0
	mov	ah, 0x0e
	mov	al, 'A'
	int	0x10
This will print the character 'A' on the screen.
